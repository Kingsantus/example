    <h1>Creed Tech</h1>
    <p>I want to be a professional web developer, I dream of it everytime yet I'm not even inch to my goal.</p>
    <p>I work about 11 hours everyday and sometimes it seems like am learning the wrong thing, <br> it took me about 1 year to open react on my personal computer</p>
    <p>As a django developer I was thinking it will be more of an app, a complete work on django is about 100 megabyte but on React to initialize it about 220 megabyte yet am not going to use all of it</p>
